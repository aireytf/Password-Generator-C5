# Password-Generator-C5

## Description

This repository serves to showcase my work in completing the Module 5 Challenge of my edX Bootcamp.

This was a real-world situation challenge, tasking me with modifying JavaScript starter code to create an application that could be used by an employee to generate a random password. 

My modified code was required to meet the following criteria:

- Generate a password when the relevant button is clicked.
  
- Present a series of prompts for password criteria.
  
- Length of password: At least 8 characters but no more than 128.
  
- Character types: Lowercase, Uppercase, Numeric & Special characters ($@%&*, etc).
  
- Code should validate for each input and at least one character type should be selected.
  
- Once prompts are answered then the password should be generated and displayed in an alert or written to the page.

My final application was to resemble the following Demo:
